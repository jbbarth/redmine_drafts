# Redmine Drafts Plugin

This plugin is an answer to issue [#2910](http://www.redmine.org/issues/2910) : if you accidentally leave an issue while editing it, and if it's very large, it can drive you crazy to lose everything you typed before. There can be at least 2 approaches to avoid losing data this way :
* forbid leaving the page with a javascript warning
* saving drafts periodically so you can find and restore it when you're back on the issue page : this is the method this plugin tries to implement

## Install

You can first take a look at general instructions for plugins [here](http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins).

Then :
* clone this repository in your `plugins/` directory ; if you have a doubt you put it at the good level, you can check you have a `plugins/redmine_drafts/init.rb` file
* run the migrations and copy assets, from your redmine root directory with the command : `RAILS_ENV=production rake redmine:plugins`
* restart your Redmine instance (depends on how you host it)
