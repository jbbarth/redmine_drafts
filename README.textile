h1. Redmine Drafts Plugin

This plugin is an answer to issue "#2910":http://www.redmine.org/issues/2910 : if you accidentally leave an issue while editing it, and if it's very large, it can drive you crazy to lose everything you typed before. There can be at least 2 approaches to avoid losing data this way :
* forbid leaving the page with a javascript warning
* saving drafts periodically so you can find and restore it when you're back on the issue page : this is the method this plugin tries to implement

h2. Install

You can first take a look at general instructions for plugins "here":http://www.redmine.org/wiki/redmine/Plugins.

Then :
* clone this repository in your vendor/plugins directory ; if you have a doubt you put it at the good level, you can check you have a vendor/plugins/redmine_drafts/init.rb file
* run the migrations from your redmine root directory with command : @rake db:migrate_plugins@
* restart your Redmine instance (depends on how you host it)

h2. Contribute

If you like this plugin, it's a good idea to contribute :
* by giving feed back on what is cool, what should be improved
* by reporting bugs : you can open issues directly on github for the moment
* by forking it and sending pull request if you have a patch or a feature you want to implement
